I actually didn't make this blog design from secretch as it requires a lots of time.Instead I used a css framework, we.css, to make ir resposive
The reason I used this framework is, it is lightweight in nature, support some predifined component which helped me to speed up the development
time of the project.
All the files in my project are inside .php files. So, you need to start server to see the project in work. Thanks
